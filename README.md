## About Me

I have been studying computer science and front end development for over a year, am currently enrolled on Harvard's CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science, as well as EDX bootcamp in front end web development. 

I have gained invaluable experience working with others thanks to the bootcamp, as well as expanding upon my knowledge that I have gained throughout the various courses and projects I have taken prior to now. 

I am a strong team member who aims to build other people up and work with their strengths to create a positive, educational and motivated working environment. 

I am self motivated, organised and able to work independently with efficiency and enthusiasm when required. 

I spend my free time creating different projects with code, I have a very particular interest in learning C and eventually Assembly, as well as spending time with my family and friends, be that performing music with them or days out to historical towns and cities. 

My long term goal is to become a games developer, starting from web development and progressing on to experience all aspects of a development lifecycle and process. I am a very keen learner and hope to build upon my current knowledge with every experience within the tech industry.
